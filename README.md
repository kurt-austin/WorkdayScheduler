# WorkdayScheduler

This is a daily Jquery calendar between the hours of 9AM and 5PM local time.  User inputs the events and then clicks the Save icon on the far left.

The shading represents three things.  Current hour is shaded in a reddish tone.  Future hours are shaded in Green and past hours are shaded in Gray.

I used Jquery methods and Local Storage to store any entries that were made and kept when the page is refreshed.
